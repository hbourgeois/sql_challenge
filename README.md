# sql_challenge

Background/Overview:
	Design SQL tables to hold and analyze archived employee data from the 1980's and 1990's (fictional data)

Notes:
Original CSV files did not have dates in a SQL-friendly format
the date_conversions.ipynb file converts the original dates into YYYY-MM-DD and outputs a corrected CSV that is imported in the SQL database
